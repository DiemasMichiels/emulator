## Requirements

### Android Studio

To run Android emulators you need to have Android studio and already created the Android Virtual Devices.

Add the Android Studio emulator script to your settings in Visual Studio Code:  
You can either set the default path or specify a specific path for each operating system. The default path will always be the fallback.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default: `"emulator.emulatorPath": "~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac: `"emulator.emulatorPathMac": "~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux: `"emulator.emulatorPathLinux": "~/Android/Sdk/emulator"`
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows: `"emulator.emulatorPathWindows":`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"<yourAndroidHome>\\Sdk\\emulator\\emulator.exe"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"C:\\Users\\<yourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\emulator\\emulator.exe"`

Your visual studio code settings are found here:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File -> Preferences -> Setting -> User Setting -> Extensions -> Emulator Configuration

You now have the option to start Android emulators in cold boot modus. Activate it in your settings in Visual Studio Code:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Android Cold Boot: `true`

### Xcode
