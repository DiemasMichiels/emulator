## Requirements

### Android Studio

To run Android emulators you need to have Android studio and already created the Android Virtual Devices.

Add the Android Studio emulator script to your settings of Visual Studio Code:  
You can either set the default path or specify a specific path for each operating system. The default path will always be the fallback.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default: `"emulator.emulatorPath": "~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mac: `"emulator.emulatorPathMac": "~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux: `"emulator.emulatorPathLinux": "~/Android/Sdk/emulator"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows: `"emulator.emulatorPathWindows":`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"<yourAndroidHome>\\Sdk\\emulator"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"C:\Users\<yourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WSL: `"emulator.emulatorPathWSL": "/mnt/c/Users/<yourUsername>/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/emulator"`

Your visual studio code settings are found here:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File -> Preferences -> Setting -> User Setting -> Extensions -> Emulator Configuration

Enable selection for cold boot Android emulators. Activate it in your settings of Visual Studio Code:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Android Cold Boot: `true`

WSL has some limitations with the Android emulator and because of that some devices might not work. It will throw an ARM error even if the device is x86.

### Xcode

To run iOS emulators Xcode is required.

If your Xcode or simulator is not installed in the default location it is possible to set the correct path of the Simulator.app file:  
`"emulator.simulatorPath": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app"`
